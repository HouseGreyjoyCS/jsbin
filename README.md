JS-Bin
A Javascript Pair-Programming Tool Built with React, Web Workers and Express.

Admin-Page
The Admin Page allows for the creation, deletion of Bins. From this screen bins can also have passwords set on them that will prompt the users when they navigate to the bin to log in.

Bin

Web Sockets
Bin's allow for the execution of code with the results being displayed in the terminal. The bins use Web Sockets in order to communicate between other active users in the bin. Each Bin is setup in it's own room, which means that the sockets only connect users that are in the same bin.

Web Worker
Additionally the "Run Code" runs a Web Worker with the current code in the Code Editor packaged inside of it. All console.log's inside of this are intercepted and sent back to the bin to be displayed in the terminal.
